    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, butterscotch pudding mix, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and vegetable oil until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the melted butterscotch chips.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and bake for about 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and cool completely on wire racks.</li>
        <li>For the frosting, beat together the powdered sugar, cream (or milk), and melted butterscotch chips until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost the layers and stack them. Press additional butterscotch chips onto the sides of the cake for decoration.</li>
